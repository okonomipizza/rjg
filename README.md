# rjg

A Random JSON Generator written in Go.
This project is inspired by the Rust-based [rjg](https://github.com/sile/rjg) and provides similar functionality in a Go implementation.
While this implementation closely mimics the behavior of rjg, it is not an official Go version of rjg.
It was developed independently to provide similar functionality in a Go-based tool.
Additionally, this project was created as part of the author's learning experience with Go.
